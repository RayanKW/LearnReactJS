I am undertaking a journey to learn React Native in 12-16 weeks for cross app dev
#
By the end of the process I am committed to creating apps just to test my knowledge and expand
after all you learn best by reading, exercising, telling and teaching about then more application of whatever you've learnt. Don't look that up, I've just invented it right now. :)
#
This repo serves as my way of reminding myself, hey dude you have a commit to make plus, commitments can't be that bad. I've not had a gf in like never so if you have the answer reach out.
But in all seriousness goal setting and target are very good motivators to help.
My process in a task is: I decontruct the whole task into small manageable task. I completely ignore the magnitude of the task at hand and do the small bits to perfection.
After working on them isolatedly now i join the pieces together to make the whole. It's efficient and you'll never lack motivation.
#
so this repo is me breaking down the whole task and after creating a directory and a commit best belive that topic i've read an understood.
#
this will be so tiring and challanging and I'm so excited.
